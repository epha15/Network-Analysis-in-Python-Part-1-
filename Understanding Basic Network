By definition, a Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) along with identified pairs of nodes (called edges, links, etc). 
In NetworkX, nodes can be any hashable object e.g. a text string, an image, an XML object, another Graph, a customized node 
object, etc. (Note: Pythonâ€™s None object should not be used as a node as it determines whether optional function arguments 
have been assigned in many functions.)

import networkx as nx
X = nx.Graph()
X.add_edge(1,1)
X.add_edge(1,2)
X.add_edge(2,1)
X.add)edge(2,2)

nodes that are available are 1 and 2. edge(1,2) and edge (2,1) are the same edge line
